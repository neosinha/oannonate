# Open Image Annonate
OAnnotate is a an open source Image Annotation and re-sizing library. Image Annotation, aka drawing bounding boxes, is a major first step into developing vision processing. This is also the most tedious and most error prone step of the entire deep learning process.  The goal of this project is to ease the pain.
